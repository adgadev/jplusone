*JPlusOne* is a Java library designed primarily to detect and report situations where N+1 SELECT problem occurs, i.e. initialization of lazy collection of entities
or initialization of entity proxy, resulting in additional SQL statement(s).

== Features
The tool is not limited only to detecting lazy loading / N+1 problems. Apart from that it:

* Shows general activity at JPA and SQL level related with some business scenarios, not necessarily related with lazy loading.
* Shows tree of application method calls and SQL statements (discarding all non-relevant data) associated with some business operation (i.e. REST controller endpoint call) in a handy way.
* Allows to easily correlate JPA operations with resulting SQL statements.
* Shows SQL statements with their parameters in simplified and pretty-printed form.
* Uses Spring Boot Auto Configuration to seamlessly integrate with your application.
* Provides Assertion API which can be used to write tests checking various aspects of JPA operations / SQL statements, i.e.
if lazy loading has not started occurring in given test scenario or amount of SELECT queries is not larger than some amount  [*This feature is still in development*]

More about N+1 SELECT problem you can find in link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/97197/what-is-the-n1-selects-problem-in-orm-object-relational-mapping/39696775[this] thread at StackOverflow.

== Dependencies
* Java 9 or later
* Spring Boot 2.x
* JPA 2.x (Hibernate as implementation provider required)
* Slf4j

== Installation
Add the following dependency to your project:
[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.adgadev.jplusone</groupId>
    <artifactId>jplusone-core</artifactId>
    <version>{release_version}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

The jplusone logger must be configured to debug level in order to log JPA operations / SQL statements reports.
It can be accomplised by adding following lines to your `application.yml`
[source,yaml]
----
logging.level:
    com.adgadev.jplusone: DEBUG
----

== Usage
JPlusOne tool is able to generate report showing all kind of JPA operations / SQL statements, but in order to generate such report you need
to have Spring Boot based integration tests of your application (`@SpringBootTest`), which covers scenarios you are interested in
(i.e. integration test of some endpoint of your application).

It's possible to use JPlusOne not in test but in production code, but this approach may add some additional overhead and may not be stable in some cases.

=== How it works
In order to collect data JPlusOne intercepts all operations invoked on EntityManager / EntityManagerFactory and all SQL statements invoked on DataSource and, by wrapping those beans in proxies

One report is generated per each JPA EntityManager instance (Hibernate session). A report is written to log just after EntityManager is closed.
It's worth to mention that behaviour determining when EntityManager is closed (session is closed) can be altered by:

* using `@Transactional` on integration test class or test case method - it extends scope of SUT's session / transaction so that it span across testcase method, session is effectively closed when test method finishes
* enabling property `spring.jpa.open-in-view` - session closes not when a method of a service annotated with `@Transactional` is finished, but when controller which invoked such service method is finished
Usually Spring uses separate session per transaction strategy, but


=== Types of operations
JPlusOne uses following terms to categorize operations:

* *Explicit operation* - explicit invocation of some API utilizing Java Persistence API (JPA) which in result triggers some kind of SQL statement,
i.e. SpringDataJPA repository or EntityManager or QueryDsl
* *Implicit operation* - All kind of situations where SQL statements were triggered without some explicit call on JPA based API,
i.e. as a result of traversing domain entities graph which was not fully loaded or invoking method on proxy entity, or by flushing dirty entity / collection

== Configuration
==== Default configuration
When no configuration is provided JPlusOne assumes following settings:

* The root package where application classes is located is the same as the package where the class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` is located
* Only implicit operations are reported
* Only SQL SELECT statements are reported
* Operations / SQL statements triggered by Flyway are ignored

==== Custom configuration
You can overwrite default configuration by adding some of the following properties to your `application.yml` (optional):

[source,yaml]
----
# com.adgadev.jplusone.core.properties.JPlusOneProperties
jplusone:
  enabled: true
  application-root-package: "com.sampleorganisation.sampleproject"
  debug-mode: false
  report:
    enabled: true
    output: LOGGER
    proxy-call-frames-hidden: true
    operation-filtering-mode: ALL_OPERATIONS
    statement-filtering-mode: ALL_STATEMENTS
----

Default value: `LOGGER`
|===

== Troubleshooting
==== Problems
Having JPlusOne configured, each testcase method which tests logic related with JPA persistence operations (direct or indirect use of EntityManager)
should result in either detailed report being printed in logs or the information in the logs that no JPA operations / SQL statements matching criteria has been captured.

There are multiple reasons why no logs entries for `com.adgadev.jplusone` are printed or such log entries are printed only for part of the persistence related tests. Most common cases are:

* Logging system configuration (i.e. logback) has been changed / overwritten dynamically i.e by autoconfiguration when spring boot works in debug mode ("debug: true" YAML property)
* Due to the fact that SpringRunner caches spring contexts used in tests and logging system configuration is being refreshed only during new spring context creation,
there might be a situation that invalid logging system configuration is being used when test runner intertwines execution of tests from various spring contexts.

+
In example, assuming there are two spring contexts (S1 context with logger configuration L1 and S2 context with logger configuration L2) and three test classes (A, B, C), where A and B uses S1 context and C uses S2 context.
When test runner executes tests in order A,B,C everything is fine, but when order execution is A,C,B testcases from class B will use the same logger configuration as C - L2 logger instead of L1.

==== Workarounds
There are two possible workarounds for such issue:

* Refresh JPlusOne logger configuration before executing first testcase for each integration test class:
+
[source,java]
----
@BeforeClass
public static void refreshLoggerConfiguration() {
   LoggingSystem.get(ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader())
                .setLogLevel("com.adgadev.jplusone", LogLevel.DEBUG);
}
----
* Force JPlusOne reports to be printed directly to the stdout, instead of logger, using property:
`jplusone.report.output=STDOUT`
